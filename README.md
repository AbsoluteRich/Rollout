> Rollout is your one-stop solution to bootstrap Python projects, including essentials like Git and a virtual environment.

## Background

Rollout was made to learn more about CLIs and how to make them using Python. If you...

* ...want a **simple project maker** without any fancy bells or whistles, this is the place.
* ...want **customisable project templates** and a rich ecosystem of them, use [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/).
* ...have **Node.js installed** or want an alternative to Cookiecutter, you can use [generator-python](https://github.com/thejohnfreeman/generator-python), a project generator built with [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/).
* ...want **advanced dependancy management**, use the myriad tools out there like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

## Install

Ensure that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7 or above.

<!--
### Production

Installation through [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) is recommended.

Todo: Get pipx working

Install it with the following command if you don't already have it...

```sh
pip install pipx
```

...then you can install the tool.

```sh
pipx install rollout
```

Now you can use the tool to your heart's desire.

Todo: Conflicts with the usage section

```sh
rollout my-new-project -d numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Development

See the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines on contributing.

After cloning the repository through Git or GitHub Desktop, you can use the program with the following commands:

```sh
cd src  # If your working directory isn't already in src
python main.py my-new-project -d numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

```sh
rollout my-new-project -d numpy pandas matplotlib
```
